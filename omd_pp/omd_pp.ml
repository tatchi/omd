(* Originally I had been using:
   print_string (normalize_html (Omd.to_html (Omd.of_string (to_string (Omd.of_channel ic))))) but it seems
   the of_channel and of_string can sometimes provide different results! spec-142 of_string added an extra newline
   afaict, so to try and be as consistent as possible in this test, I'm writing it back to another file and
   then re-reading it using of_channel... *)
